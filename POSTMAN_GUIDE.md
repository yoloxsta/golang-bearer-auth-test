# Postman Testing Guide

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Server is running on `http://localhost:8080`
- Postman is installed

### Import Collection

1. Open Postman
2. Click "Import" button (top left)
3. Click "Upload Files"
4. Select `postman_collection.json` from this project

---

## 📋 Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Health Check (No Auth Required)

**Request:**
```
GET http://localhost:8080/health
```

**Steps:**
1. Open "Health Check" request
2. Click "Send"

**Expected Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "message": "Server is running"
}
```

✅ This proves the server is running!

---

### Scenario 2: GET User (With Auth)

**Request:**
```
GET http://localhost:8080/users/1
Authorization: Bearer secret_token_12345
```

**Steps:**
1. Open "Users" folder → "Get User"
2. Check "Authorization" tab shows Bearer token
3. Click "Send"

**Expected Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "username": "johndoe"
}
```

✅ Bearer token authentication works!

---

### Scenario 3: POST Create User

**Request:**
```
POST http://localhost:8080/users
Authorization: Bearer secret_token_12345
Content-Type: application/json

Body:
{
  "name": "Jane Smith",

```json
{
  "id": 2,
  "name": "Jane Smith",
  "email": "jane.smith@example.com",
  "username": "janesmith"
}
```

✅ POST request creates new resource!

---

### Scenario 4: PUT Update User (Full)

**Request:**
```
PUT http://localhost:8080/users/1
Authorization: Bearer secret_token_12345
Content-Type: application/json

Body:
{
  "name": "John Updated",
  "email": "john.updated@example.com",
  "username": "johnupdated"
}
```

**Steps:**
1. Open "Users" folder → "Update User (PUT)"
2. Check all fields in Body
3. Click "Send"

**Expected Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "John Updated",
  "email": "john.updated@example.com",
  "username": "johnupdated"
}
```

✅ PUT replaces entire resource!

---

### Scenario 5: PATCH Update User (Partial)

**Request:**
```
PATCH http://localhost:8080/users/1
Authorization: Bearer secret_token_12345
Content-Type: application/json

Body:
{
  "name": "John Patched"
}
```

**Steps:**
1. Open "Users" folder → "Update User (PATCH)"
2. Notice only "name" field in Body
3. Click "Send"

**Expected Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "John Patched",

```

✅ PATCH updates only specified fields!  
Notice: email and username unchanged!

---

### Scenario 6: DELETE User

**Request:**
```
DELETE http://localhost:8080/users/1
Authorization: Bearer secret_token_12345
```

**Steps:**
1. Open "Users" folder → "Delete User"
2. Click "Send"

**Expected Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "message": "User deleted successfully",
  "data": {
    "id": 1
  }
}
```

✅ DELETE removes resource!

---

### Scenario 7: Test Posts (Same Pattern)

Repeat the same tests for Posts:

1. **GET Post** - `GET /posts/1`
2. **Create Post** - `POST /posts`
3. **Update Post** - `PUT /posts/1`
4. **Delete Post** - `DELETE /posts/1`

All work the same way as Users!

---

## 🔐 Authentication Tests

### Test 1: No Token (Should Fail)

**Steps:**
1. Open "Auth Tests" folder → "No Token (Should Fail)"
2. Notice no Authorization header
3. Click "Send"

**Expected Response (401 Unauthorized):**
```json
{
  "error": "Missing Authorization header"
}
```

✅ Server rejects requests without token!

---

### Test 2: Wrong Token (Should Fail)

**Steps:**
1. Open "Auth Tests" folder → "Wrong Token (Should Fail)"
2. Check Authorization shows "wrong_token"
3. Click "Send"

**Expected Response (401 Unauthorized):**
```json
{
  "error": "Invalid token"
}
```

✅ Server validates token correctly!

## 📊 Understanding Responses

### Status Codes

| Code | Meaning | When You See It |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| 200 | OK | Successful GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE |
| 201 | Created | Successful POST |
| 400 | Bad Request | Invalid JSON or missing fields |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Missing or invalid token |
| 405 | Method Not Allowed | Wrong HTTP method |

### Response Headers

Check the "Headers" tab in response to see:
- `Content-Type: application/json`
- Status code and reason

---

## 🎯 Complete Test Flow

Run these in order to test everything:

1. ✅ Health Check (no auth)

## 🔧 Customizing Requests

### Change the Token

1. Click collection name "Go REST API Lab"
2. Go to "Variables" tab
3. Change `token` value
4. Save

All requests will use the new token!

### Change the URL

1. Click collection name
2. Go to "Variables" tab
3. Change `base_url` value
4. Save

Now you can test against different servers!

### Modify Request Body

1. Open any POST/PUT/PATCH request
2. Go to "Body" tab
3. Edit the JSON
4. Click "Send"

Try different data!

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

### Save Responses

Click "Save Response" to keep examples for later.

### Use Tests Tab

Add automatic tests in the "Tests" tab:

```javascript
pm.test("Status is 200", function () {
    pm.response.to.have.status(200);
});

pm.test("Response has id", function () {
    var jsonData = pm.response.json();
    pm.expect(jsonData).to.have.property('id');
});
```

### Use Pre-request Scripts

Add dynamic data in "Pre-request Script":

```javascript
pm.variables.set("timestamp", Date.now());
```

### Run Collection

Click "Run" button to execute all requests automatically!

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Could not get response"
- Check server is running
- Verify URL is `http://localhost:8080`
- Check firewall settings

### "401 Unauthorized"
- Verify token is `secret_token_12345`
- Check Authorization type is "Bearer Token"
- Make sure token is in collection variables

### "400 Bad Request"
- Check JSON syntax in Body
- Verify all required fields are present
- Check Content-Type is `application/json`

### "Connection refused"
- Server is not running
- Start server: `cd server && go run server.go`

---

## 📸 Visual Guide

### Setting Up Authorization
